# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

A collection of hacks and tools used during TiDB development, debugging, benchmarking, and troubleshooting. This is a utility/scripts repo, not a single application.

## Language & Tooling

Go-based project (per .gitignore). Expect standalone tools/scripts rather than a unified build target.
